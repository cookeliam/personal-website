            <p>My passion for computer science started by making newsletters on 
                Microsoft Publisher in 4th grade. My elementary school required you
                to be in 5th grade to participate in the newspaper, so I chose to create 
                my own. In 6th grade, I scrapped together some copied HTML and CSS onto a 
                weebly website to create a chat room for my classmates to use. While cool at
                the time, teachers eventually found out and I had to take down the website. 
                This prompted my school to hold an assembly on the internet and social media ──
                take it as you will, but I consider it an achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In high school I created a website for students to upload and study exam materials 
                using a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend paired with a MySQL database using
                PHP as a server-side language. Word spread and eventually it seemed everyone was using
                my website. At this moment, my mentality regarding computer science changed; I could
                create something genuinely meaningful and impactful for others using the tools I learned.
            </p>

                I've since then grown to program full-stack web applications and even teach 
                others programming concepts through languages like Python, Java, and Javascript. This past
                summer, I taught kids ranging from 5 to 16 years old computer science concepts and programming
                principles using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Python. I also led a robotics camp teaching
                kids to code their own robots using Scratch. This experience not only solidified my programming
                fundamentals, but gave me further inspiration to continue learning computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I'm currently a junior in the Computer Science Honors Program at Stony Brook University, 
                I'm always studying and learning new concepts, languages, and theory around computer 
                science as part of my curriculum. I'm currently aspiring to become a website developer
                and designer, and am open to internship positions in front-end, full-stack, and software engineering.
